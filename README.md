# Food Calorie Prediction Project
This repo contains my food calorie regression project with Codeup.

### Steps to Reproduce
- You will need to go to this website, <a href="https://tools.myfooddata.com/nutrition-facts-database-spreadsheet.php">My Food Data</a> and open the file up in Google Sheets. The following punctuation needs to be removed before data can be read via Pandas, "():-,". Furthermore, these columns should be dropped, Serving Weight 1-9 description g (the 1-9 is because there are 9 columns with this name).
- Clone this repo and ensure wrangle.py and prepare.py are on your local machine.
- Verify *.xlsx is in the .gitignore to ensure the xlsx file is not pushed to GitHub.
- The technologies used in this project are Python 3.9.5, Pandas 1.3.5, MatPlotLib 3.5.0, Numpy 1.21.2 Seaborn 0.11.2, Scipy 1.7.3, and SkLearn 1.0.1. The notebook named report.ipynb should run.

### Plan
- Wrangle the data from the xlsx file.
- Visualizations and statistical tests.
- Regression and clustering machine learning using ENTER CHOSEN MODELS HERE.
- Fit on the training data and check for overfitting with the validation data.
- Pick the best model to test and move into production.
- Discuss some recommendations and next steps I would like to do with this project.
