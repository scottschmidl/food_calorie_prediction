### Steps to Reproduce
You will need to go to this <a href=" https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0OR9HL">Harvard's Dataverse</a> and download the three csv files. Clone this repo and ensure wrangle.py and prepare.py are on your local machine. Additionally, verify *.csv is in the git ignore to ensure the csv files are not pushed to GitHub. The technologies used in this project are Python 3.9.5, Pandas 1.3.5, MatPlotLib 3.5.0, Numpy 1.21.2 Seaborn 0.11.2, Scipy 1.7.3, and SkLearn 1.0.1. The notebook named report.ipynb should run.

### Plan
The plan is to wrangle the data either from three CSV files. Then, I  will do some visualizations and compliment them with some statistical tests. Finally, I will do some regression and clustering machine learning using ENTER CHOSEN MODELS HERE. I will fit on the training data and check for overfitting with the validation data. I will then pick the best model to test and move into production. I will then discuss some recommendations and next steps I would like to do with this project.
